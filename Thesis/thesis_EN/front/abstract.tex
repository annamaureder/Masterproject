\chapter{Abstract}


The proposed work describes a method for pose estimation of articulated objects without any prior knowledge of their body parts. Most existing pose estimation methods take advantage of trackers, and user inputs to estimate the joint positions. However, a completely unsupervised method constitutes an enormous potential but also a great challenge. A main solution to that is proposed by template matching associated with the non-rigid registration of meshes, which requires two poses of the same object and applies the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to segment the object into its rigid parts. This is done iteratively by assigning mesh points on body parts and finding transformations that perfectly match those body parts on both meshes. Based on this approach, a segmentation method is developed to obtain the rigid parts of an object and consequently estimate its joints.
