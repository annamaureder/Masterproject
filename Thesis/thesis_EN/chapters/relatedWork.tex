Here comes the State-of the Art.
An overview of related methods to Non-rigid Registration for detecting rigid body parts of an articulated object are mentioned here \cite{chang08articulated} which mainly use the ICP (iterative closest point) and the PCA (Principal component analysis) to find corresponding body parts. This paper is based on the Correlated Correspondance algorithm \cite{CorrelatedCorrespondance} \cite{Anguelov04} and Symmetrization \cite{Mitra07}. A following work to \cite{chang08articulated} is \cite{chang09range}. Other methods include temporal coherence, markers and user inputs.
