This chapter optimizes existing methods for object segmentation and detection of part correspondances. As input the methods take two point clouds that represent two similar objects in two different poses.

\section{EM algorithm to segment a 2 part object}

The algorithm starts with a set of point clouds P_1 ... P_N of the same object in different configurations.
