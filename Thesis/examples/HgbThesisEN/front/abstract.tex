\chapter{Abstract}

The proposed work addresses the issue of identifying the rigid parts of an unknown articulated object to subsequently estimate its pose represented by its joints. Most existing pose estimation methods take advantage of user inputs to estimate the joint positions, e.g. markers or an object model. However, unsupervised methods constitute a great potential as they operate completely independent from manual user input. A main solution for this situation is proposed by the non-rigid registration of an articulated object in different poses, also referred to as template matching. Inspired by unsupervised state-of-the art pose estimation procedures, two segmentation approaches are implemented. The main goal is thereby to reduce the number of computation steps of segmenting an articulated object into its rigid parts.
