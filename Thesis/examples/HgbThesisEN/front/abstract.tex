\chapter{Abstract}

The proposed work addresses the issue of identifying the rigid parts of an unknown articulated object. Most existing pose estimation methods take advantage of user inputs to estimate the joint positions, e.g. trackers and markers. However, not many completely unsupervised methods exist. A main solution for this situation is proposed by template matching associated with the non-rigid registration of meshes. First, state-of-the-art methods related to the non-rigid-registration are proposed.  Subsequently, an approach is developed and tested in 2D as well as in 3D. It is based on the divide and conquer principle to reduce the number of computation steps of iteratively detecting rigid parts in two point clouds, describing the same object in different poses.
